# Simulating Higher-Harmonic Generation using Gaussian Basis Sets
Contains python scripts, ipython notebooks and data from our study on using the TDCI approach with Gaussian basis sets for simulating higher-harmonic generation (HHG).

## basissets
The optimized basis sets for calculating HHG spectra in psi4 format (as `.gbs` files). 

## data

## scripts
All the python scripts used to run TDCI simulations using `pyci` and `psi4`

## notebooks
The visualizations of our data from TDCI simulations as ipython notebooks.
